# Calculate Due Date

Calculate Due Date is a simple utility to calculate the due date for a submitted ticket.

## Install

`npm install` will install the dependencies -- that is, the only dependency: _Chai_.

## Run

`npm start` will run the app and return the result for a few example inputs.

## Test

`npm test` will run the unit tests.

**Note:** You need to have Mocha installed globally to run the tests. In order to do so, run `npm install -g mocha`. Tested with version `5.2.0`.
